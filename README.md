# myPortfolio
Hi my name is John and this is my portfolio, it's always growing and being updated.
The projects are some of my current or ongoing freelance projects. This is two-fold, you the viewer get to see how I update these sites,
and the individuals who have commissioned these sites have a live view of their site as we work through the design process.
